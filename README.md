# XRF_Entry
Web interface for XRF data entry.

One of my research projects needs a big amount of XRF (X-ray fluorescence) data from Martian meteorites and in-situ Mars missions. I started to enter the data into an excel file, and after some time feel boring entering data. Then I thought to create an R-shiny app that I can access through my webpage (www.gayantha.net).

Here is the output. This is an R app you can install to your Rstudio. After install type "xrf_entry() command in the R console to open the interface. The username is "Guest" and Password is "1234".
